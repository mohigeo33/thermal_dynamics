## 1. About the study
Rapid urbanisation in the global south has often introduced substantial and rapid uncontrolled Land Use 
and Land Cover changes (LULC), considerably affecting the Land Surface Temperature (LST) patterns. 
Understanding the relationship between LULC changes and LST is essential to mitigate such effects, 
considering the urban heat island (UHI). This study aims to elucidate the spatiotemporal variations 
and alterations of LST in urban areas compared to LULC changes. The study focused on a peripheral urban 
area of Phnom Penh (Cambodia) undergoing rapid urban development. Using Landsat images from 2000 to 2021, 
the analysis employed an exploratory time-series analysis of LST. The study revealed noticeable variability 
in LST (20 to 69Â°C), predominantly influenced by seasonal variability and LULC changes. The study also 
provided insights into how LST varies within different LULCs at the exact spatial locations. These changes
in LST did not manifest uniformly but displayed site-specific responses to LULC changes. This study accounts
for changing land surfaces' complex physical energy interaction over time. The methodology offers a replicable 
model for other similarly structured, rapidly urbanised regions utilising novel semi-automatic processing of LST 
from Landsat images, potentially inspiring future research in various urban planning and monitoring contexts.

## 3. Remote sensing data used in the study
We used collection-1: Tier 1 data from Landsat 5, 7 and 8. Both surface reflectance (SR)
and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) data via Google Earth Engine image archive data are provided 
by the NASA/USGS Landsat program. The images in the study area are highly susceptible to 
the presence of clouds. Hence, a maximum of 60% cloud filter is applied. Each dot represents 
an image that was considered for this study. After applying the cloud filter, 425 images from
2000 to 2021 were selected for the study (Figure 1).

## 4. Study area

Chbar Ampov District, located in the southeast region of Phnom Penh, Cambodia, is a rapidly developing urban area 
with a mix of residential and commercial zones. The Mekong River borders the district from the north, the Meanchey 
District to the west, the Kien Svay District to the east and the Bassac River to the south.

## 5. LST estimation and spectral indices calculation
The following steps were taken to estimate the LST and calculate the spectral indices from Landsat images (Figure 4)
